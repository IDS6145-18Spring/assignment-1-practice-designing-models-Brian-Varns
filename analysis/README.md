## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

I chose Anylogic because of its simplicity and cost-effective capability for students.  Additionally, how the Agents, EPA Pollutants in my experiment, interact with the sensors, population, and city leaders can be handled by Anylogic's processes. Anylogic capabilities can be found at: https://www.anylogic.com

The simulation will release Agents (EPA Pollutants) into the environment, which in this case is one city block.  These Agents will have different concentrations of EPA Pollutants (heavy, medium, normal).  Sensors will detect these agents and update the populace on the current pollutants in their area.  The Sensors default status will be “normal” and will only alert city leaders and population if the status moves into medium or heavy.  If the status of the pollutants changes the simulation will then gather data on how the populace reacts to this change.  Do they stay indoors, do they still go outside to exercise or walk their dog, etc.  Additionally, city leaders can make decisions to help control the level of pollutants, do they close the street, shut down bridges, etc.?  With this simulation I can gather a small data set to analyze outcomes.

The Air Pollution Control System will collect data on the following items:

1.How many Air Pollutants are in the Environment (what level heavy, medium, normal)
2.How many accurate alerts are provided by the sensors
3.How many alerts are inaccurate or missed by the sensors
4.Population reaction to these alerts
5.City Leaders reaction to these alerts
